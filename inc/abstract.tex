% This is a summary of the thesis including the conclusion of what was discovered.

Redirected Walking uses rotation, translation and curvature gains to manipulate users of VR environments. This paper presents a new detection threshold for rotation, translation and curvature gain for the HTC Vive. The calculated rotation gain was 13\% increased and 21\% decreased rotation. For translation gain, 19\% increased and 5\% decreased movement. The detection threshold for curvature gain was a circle with a radius of less than 29m. When comparing these results to previous studies, which used hardware with lower resolution and FOV, the results indicate that it is easier to detect two type of gain, increased rotation and decreased translation in the HTC Vive. Further we discuss if there is a range beyond detection, but that is still comfortable for the user. The results indicate that for some, there are detectable gains that are still comfortable, but this is extremely dependant on the person's sensitivity to the given gain.
